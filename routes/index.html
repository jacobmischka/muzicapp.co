		<h2>Sick of your music?</h2>

		<p>
			How many times have we all thought or said the following: I'M SICK OF MY MUSIC.
			When you find yourself needing new music, you want it FAST and NOW.
			The reality is you have to go digging for new jams because you’re
			blasted with endless options in the browse section of Spotify or
			Apple Music. Even if you’re an avid fan of Spotify’s Discover Weekly,
			Apple Music’s The Beat’s 1 List or any playlist you follow, you still
			have to listen to 30-60 songs just to find a couple of new songs you like.
			Assuming each song is roughly 3 minutes long, thats 90 minutes of listening
			time for 6 minutes of new music. That is a great deal of input for so
			little output. In a perfect world, the quickest and easiest way to
			discover new music would be to text your friends “hey, I need new music”
			but that is a hassle for both parties involved.
		</p>

		<p>
			Interesting enough our friends are feeding us new music on social media
			all the time (and vice versa). But still no one is discovering new music
			this way and those that would potentially share music are deterred from
			doing so. Why? Well, how many times have we seen (or posted) a song
			screenshot from Spotify or Apple Music on Instagram, Snapchat etc?
			As the viewer, you usually skip over this post because the inconvenience
			of shifting from Instagram to Spotify, for example, greatly outweighs the
			potential of discovering a banger. As the sharer, you know viewers are
			skipping over these posts because you do the same, so why share in the
			first place? We all clearly want to share our music and discover our
			friends' music but there's a disconnect. Here’s how MUZIC is the
			connecting piece.
		</p>

		<p>
			Remember before Spotify or Apple Music was a thing, what determined
			whether or not you bought a song off of iTunes was that 30 second song
			preview? If you liked what you heard in those 30 seconds, you bought the
			song for 99 cents. Hated it? You moved on to a different 30 second preview.
			What if there was an Instagram for music but instead of pictures, you and
			your friends shared 15-30 second previews of songs. Similar to how you
			browse Instagram in your down time, you’d browse MUZIC but as you scroll
			and listen to 15 second previews, you’d  save the songs you previewed
			right then and there to your MUZIC library. Once that “I need new music”
			feeling comes along you already have a whole collection of new songs you
			know you’ll like. Think of this collection like your Pinterest board for
			music. Not only are you are always passively on the search for new music
			but you won’t have to dig for new music again while aging a good 20 years
			while doing it. Stay youthful my friends. This is MUZIC.
